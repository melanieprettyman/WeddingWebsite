    about:
      "Mitch grew up in Germantown, Wisconsin, where his natural curiosity and love for discovery fueled his passion for science. His academic journey began with a degree in Biochemistry from Stevens Point, continued with a Masterâ€™s in Pharmacology at St. Johnâ€™s University in New York City, and culminated in a PhD in Biochemistry at the University of Utah. When heâ€™s not immersed in science, Mitch enjoys exploring imaginative worlds through sci-fi novels, expressing his creativity with painting, and unwinding with video games. As the only child of Tanya Weber and James Wopat, he shares a close bond with his family. Known for his sharp analytical mind and natural ability to lead, Mitch is a trusted friend, devoted son, and someone who inspires those around him.",
